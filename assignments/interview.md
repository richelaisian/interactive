## Interview

**Do you make things?**

Yeah...

**What things do you make?**

I make paintings, I make prints. I sew some things. I think that about covers it.

**Why do make those things? I'm going to edit this...heavily.**

I make them because I feel drawn to do so. 

**Do you like making things**

I do like making things, yes.

**How is it different to work on a painting from, for example a print?**

I think that the way I think about process and time and ability to manipulate and change things differs depending on the medium, so with a painting I'll often start out with some sort of loose sketch to figure out some basic idea of what I'm making but that really changes as the process goes along, with layering things and seeing how the paint is working, how the colors are working together, it evolves as it goes. Whereas in printing, while there is a similar process of layering and adapting along the way it's much more in set stages. If I'm making a screenprint that's going to be a four color separation
