            offered them in the Invites Forum. Unsolicited invite requests, even by private message, are prohibited.

            Exposing or threatening to expose private information about users for any reason is prohibited. Private information includes, but is not limited to, personally identifying information (e.g., names, records, biographical details, photos). Information that has not been openly volunteered by a user should not be discussed or shared without permission. This includes private information collected via investigations into openly volunteered information (e.g., Google search results).

            Disagreements must be discussed privately with the deciding moderator. If the moderator has retired or is unavailable, you may send a Staff PM. Do not contact multiple moderators hoping to find one amenable to your cause; however, you may contact a site administrator if you require a second opinion. Options for contacting staff include private message, Staff PM, and #help on IRC.

          <p>

            Commercializing services provided by or code maintained by APOLLO (e.g., Gazelle, Ocelot) is prohibited. Commercializing content provided by APOLLO users via the aforementioned services (e.g., user torrent data) is prohibited.

          <p>
            You may browse the site through a private server/proxy only if it has a static IP address unique to you, or through your private or shared seedbox. Note that this applies to every kind of proxy, including VPN services, Tor, and public proxies. When in doubt, send a Staff PM seeking approval of your proxy or VPN. See our Proxy/VPN Tips and Multiple IPs articles for more information.
