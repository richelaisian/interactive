              Self promotion rules: Codepens, github/bitbucket repos, or useful code contributions are generally allowed. Tutorials which do not include commercial products or services, and do not include soliciting for services may be allowed, but are subject to rediquette
              rules. Editorials or perspectives should be limited to community blog locations such as medium.com, or posted directly to reddit. Blogs which include links to other services are subject to removal. Self posts which provide the community
              with useful insight are encouraged.
