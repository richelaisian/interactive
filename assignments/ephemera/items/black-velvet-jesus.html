        A gift from my friend from high school who aquired it from a roadside stand on her drive from Washington DC to New York. Originally positioned up and down, this arrangement was determined to be "too cursed", and it was turned to its current lateral position. If you look at it for awhile, Jesus's arm begins to look like a baguette or other elongated bread.
