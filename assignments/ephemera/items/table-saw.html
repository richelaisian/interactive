        Purchased by a previous tennant and left in the basement, it is a bizarre relic and our landlord hates it but never bothered to disassemble it and take it out. I've used it for a few carpentry projects here and there. Made a table for the backyard with some parts from a broken down table and some maple slats that I over paid for because I didn't realize how wood was priced at Home Depot.
