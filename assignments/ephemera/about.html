"Things at Home" is an impossible project. It is a geospecific archive of an old
disordered home. The rules, put simply, are to record everything about everything in my house.
Inspired by other impossible or unending archival projects - Benjamin's Arcades Project,
the (now defunct) Library of Congress Twitter Archive, the sorting of the unearthed genizahs of
the ancient world.

It can only be accessed from my house. And it is only meaningful from there.
