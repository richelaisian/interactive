          <h2>1990 - 1995</h2>
          <p>
            Free Edgewood was founded in 1990 by Rafa Pinkney and Jordan Porkle as a community organization focused on serving the needs of the Edgewood population which had been unmet by the New Haven city government.

          <p>
            The organization began to grow and it began focusing on larger mutual aid projects and community services like child care, short term loans, tennants legal assistance and developing two plots of land in the area with community interests in mind.

          <h2>2001 - 2010</h2>
          <p>
            As more and more residents of Edgewood worked with Free Edgewood on these projects, a greater sense of community identity emerged. More projects sprung up; new solutions for Edgewood's problems, worked out by Edgewood's residents.

          <h2>2010 - present</h2>
          <p>
            In 2010 a significant majority of the Edgewood population voted to join a collection of block assemblies which emerged from Free Edgwood Projects. These assemblies would oversee the expansion and administration of the projects which developed between Free Edgewood and the community at large. Since this vote Free Edgewood has continued to maintain and expand its programs and infrastructure, just as it will continue to do.
