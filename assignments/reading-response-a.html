    <h2>Heap or Archive</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Dan:</b> Yeah, it’s like the modern condition: just throw it on the heap.
      <br><br>
      <b>Ayham:</b> Toss it back.
      <br><br>
      <b>Dan:</b> And, like, get back to it sometime.
      <br><br>
      <b>Ayham:</b> Does archiving this way cycle back to how you’re making work?
      <br><br>
      <b>Simone:</b> I don't know. I'm not that organized. I have like seven files called “final, final, final.”
      <br><br>
      <span  style="background: gainsboro;">
        <b>Jake:</b> I think that “final, final, final” thing, something almost everyone does once in a while, really gets at something essential about computers and the net.
        Like, I can have a stack of posters that I think of as finals and keep them all in the same place and see the differences between them, remembering which is which.
        That's impossible online, you can't have that stack of "finals" all together, because title and place are so linked for computers, which is weird and feels kind of wrong sometimes.

      <b>Ayham:</b> It’s not very accessible.
      <br><br>
      <b>Simone:</b> Yeah. I don't think anyone other than me could go through my files and understand.
      <br><br>
      <b>Matt:</b> There’s an interesting distinction between the heap and the archive. The Internet Archive is a heap—
      it's not sorted and filtered and accessible via tagged metadata. It’s just collected.
      <br><br>
      <b>Laurel:</b> Even though The Internet Archive calls itself an archive, we seem to believe “an archive” does
      something different.
